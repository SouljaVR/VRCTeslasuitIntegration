# VRCTeslasuitIntegration
An alpha VRChat Mod that allows for the TESLASUIT (DK1) to be used in game. 11-point tracking, advanced full body haptics and biometric data integrations are supported.

## Requirements:

- TESLASUIT DK1/M1/Founders Edition
- TESLASUIT SDK 1.7.xx+
- Windows 10 1902+
- [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- [Melonloader 5.x.x](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)
- Base PC Spec (Full tracking support, partial haptics support, full biometrics support):
  - AMD Ryzen 3600X/Intel equivalent
  - 16GB RAM
  - GTX 1080Ti or AMD equivalent
- Recommended PC Spec (Full tracking support, full AI driven haptics support, full biometrics support):
  - AMD Ryzen 5800X/Intel Equivalent
  - 64GB RAM
  - RTX 3080 (RTX is a requirement for Nvidia AI tensor acceleration)
- Competent Unity knowledge. Haptic support needs to be integrated into your avatar. As of now the process is mostly manual. An automatic setup/appliction script is in the works. A unity prefab is included with all releases with all assets required for avatar haptics support. Biometric support is based on [HRtoVRChat](https://github.com/200Tigersbloxed/UnityMods/tree/main/HRtoVRChat) by 200Tigersbloxed so their setup guide applies here too. TESLASUIT biometric data is sent to HRtoVRC via the textfile option (stored in \VRChat\UserData\TS_HR.txt)
